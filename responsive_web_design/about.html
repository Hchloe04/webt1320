            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>My favorite characters revolves around their abilities in the game and the overall stregnth and weaknesses. 
               First on my list in Baraka is a Mortal Kombat character who comes from a race in the Outlands. Hes a fierce warrior who has risen through his groups ranks to become one of the most powerful fighters.
               I also think Baraka just looks cool like most of the characters features.

               <p>My Second favorite is Noob Saibot Noob Saibot is one of the most unique characters in the entire franchise. He originated as just a silhouette of the other ninja Mortal Kombat characters. Over time hes grown a unique character and his own special moveset though.
                  Sub-ZeroNearly rounding out the Mortal Kombat 11 characters might be one of the most instantly recognisable, Sub-Zero. Sub Zero is another Ninja character, but hes had a life of its own with players finding him one of the most accessible. Through depictions in story mode and other media, hes become a lot more than a chilled ninja.
