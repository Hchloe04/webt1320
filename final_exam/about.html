            <h2>Favorite Films</h2>
            <p>The holidays are here and so is the christmas spirit that we all share through the month. Traditions of christmas movie watching is 
                one thing I am super excited about. With images, stories, and music that stimulate our sentimental and wistful associations 
                from our past. Chritmas movies can build bonds across generations and feel like visiting old friends.

               <p>"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" starring Jim Carrey is one of my all time favortie movies for the holidays. The film focuses
                   on a 'who' who is a little different than the rest. The grinch is a green grump who hates christmas. He steals christmas because 
                   he hates the idea of the jolly season. He takes it to far by stealing everthing from whoville just to ruin christmas. The grinch 
                   learns the hard way the truth about christmas.

            <h3>Favorite Films</h3>
            <p>My favorite movies are based on my childhood and the classics brought from generation to generation.
               As Holiday movies bring viewers into a fictional world, people are able to work through their own
               fears and desires about self-worth and relationships. Such movies can provide reaffirmation. which can 
               courage people to continue working through difficult situations.
