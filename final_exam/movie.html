            <h2>Disney A Christmas Carol</h2>
            <p>As the Holidays approach, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to have a perfect family Christmas, so he stresses him and his 
               family out trying to allign everything perfectly. Including house and tree christmas decorations. Things take a turn for the worse
               while everything goes wrong. His redneck cousin Eddie and family show up unannouced and Griswold doesn't receive his bonus
               causing more issues. </p>

            <p>the message of the film is that you need to manage you expections. Much of Clark's frustration comes from his idealized vision of a 
               family holiday. When he lets go and meets his family where they are, his enjoyment of the holiday increases dramatically. <p>

            <h3>Favorite Films</h3>
            <p>My favorite movies are based on my childhood and the classics brought from generation to generation.
                As Holiday movies bring viewers into a fictional world, people are able to work through their own
                fears and desires about self-worth and relationships. Such movies can provide reaffirmation. which can 
                courage people to continue working through difficult situations.
