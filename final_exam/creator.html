            <h3>Favorite Films</h3>
            <p>My favorite movies are based on my childhood and the classics brought from generation to generation.
                As Holiday movies bring viewers into a fictional world, people are able to work through their own
                fears and desires about self-worth and relationships. Such movies can provide reaffirmation. which can 
                courage people to continue working through difficult situations.
